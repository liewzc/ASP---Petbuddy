                    <h2>Our Origin</h2>
                    <p>Our organization was established to address the stress reactions that cats often experience when they leave their familiar environments, which can lead to health issues and behavioral problems. We understand that cats are highly sensitive to changes in their surroundings. To ensure they receive comprehensive care in a familiar setting while their owners are away, we focus on providing specialized cat care services.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to create a warm and safe caregiving environment to help cats alleviate anxiety and maintain their well-being. We believe that when owners are away, having their cats cared for in a familiar and loving environment will enhance their quality of life.</p>
